# Student-Habits-Academic-Performance-EDA
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset to examine how student habits and lifestyle factors influence academic performance. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis explores relationships between exam scores and variables including study hours, sleep duration, social media usage, attendance, and mental health. The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns, correlations, and insights that can help understand the key factors associated with student performance and provide a strong foundation for future machine learning modeling.
