# 📊 Student Habits & Academic Performance — EDA

## 🔍 Overview
This project explores how student habits and lifestyle factors influence academic performance using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. By analyzing a real-world dataset, the goal is to uncover meaningful patterns, correlations, and insights that explain variations in exam scores.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how daily habits affect academic outcomes  
- Identify key factors correlated with exam performance  
- Build a strong analytical foundation for future machine learning models  

---

## 🧠 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Description:** The dataset contains information about students’ study habits, lifestyle choices, and academic results, including:
  - Study hours  
  - Sleep duration  
  - Social media usage  
  - Attendance percentage  
  - Mental health rating  
  - Exam scores  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas** — data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** — core visualizations  
- **Seaborn** — advanced statistical plots  

---

## 📈 Analysis & Visualizations
The project includes:
- Distribution analysis of exam scores  
- Relationship analysis between study hours and performance  
- Lifestyle impact analysis (sleep, social media usage)  
- Correlation heatmap to identify strong positive and negative relationships  

These visualizations help transform raw data into actionable insights.

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Study hours and attendance show a strong positive correlation with exam scores  
- Excessive social media usage is moderately associated with lower performance  
- Extremely low or high sleep duration tends to correlate with poorer results  
- Lifestyle and mental health factors play a subtle but important role
